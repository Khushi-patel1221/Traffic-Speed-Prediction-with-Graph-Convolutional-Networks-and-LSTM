## Traffic Speed Prediction with Graph Convolutional Networks and LSTMs
## Project Description
This project leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict traffic speeds on various routes. The model is trained on the PeMSD7 dataset, which includes route distances and speeds. The combination of GCNs and LSTMs allows the model to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in the traffic data, providing more accurate predictions.
